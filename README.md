# 👋 Hey there, I’m Harsh!

🎯 A curious soul diving into the world of Computer Science  
💻 Learning for the love of code, not just the job  
🚀 Currently taking **CS50 (Harvard’s Intro to CS)** — and loving every byte of it  
🌱 Building projects, exploring Python, C, and Web Dev  
📚 Dreaming big, learning small — one commit at a time

---

## 🧠 What I’m working on:
- 🧩 **CS50 problem sets** & final project
- 🧪 Basic **Python scripts** for fun + learning
- 🕸️ **Web development** projects (HTML, CSS, JS)
- 🔧 Git & GitHub mastery (version control is magic tbh)
